Pistachio is a projection system for the computer game Out of the Park Baseball.

It projects:
OPS+ and WAR by position for position players
FIP and WAR for starter and reliever pitchers

Player names saved in 'flagged.txt' can be found in the outputs by typing 'flag' in the search box at the top of the html. This can be used for eg draft prospects, or any other shortlist of players created in-game.

With thanks to three public sources of info used for the original projections:
> Sgt Mushroom for his MOPS system for position players
> Donkeykong - a user on the OOTP forums - for pitchers
> OOTP calculator for logic for getting from FIP to WAR for pitchers

I first built this for a previous version of OOTP. There will therefore be various analytical points that are not up-to-date as compared to the latest version (OOTP 26 at the time of writing).

Any clear errors arising are my own, not due to the creators mentioned above.

Pull requests and feedback welcomed.
